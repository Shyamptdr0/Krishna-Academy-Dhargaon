                        The lab is furnished with modern apparatus including meters, lenses, pendulums, circuit kits, and advanced measurement tools.
                        Students are encouraged to perform both guided and independent experiments to develop critical thinking, problem-solving skills,
                        and a practical understanding of physical laws.
                        <br/>
                        Our instructors guide students in conducting experiments safely while encouraging curiosity and exploration.
                        The lab also supports project work, demonstrations, and science fairs, giving students an opportunity to apply
                        theoretical concepts in real-world scenarios.

                        Beyond routine experiments, the Physics Laboratory fosters creativity, analytical thinking, and scientific inquiry.
                        Students develop an appreciation for physics by observing phenomena, recording data, and interpreting results.
                        This hands-on approach ensures that students are not just learning physicsâ€”they are experiencing it.
